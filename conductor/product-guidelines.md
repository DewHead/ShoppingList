# Product Guidelines

## Communication Style
- **Formal and Precise:** All technical documentation, code comments, and specifications must prioritize accuracy. Edge cases, particularly in web scraping logic and synchronization protocols, must be explicitly documented.

## UI & Visual Identity
- **Material Design / Clean Utility:** The interface will adhere to Material Design principles. The focus is on clarity, accessibility, and standard UI patterns to ensure a low learning curve for users managing complex shopping lists.

## Brand Messaging
- **Direct and Helpful:** User-facing copy should be concise and focused on the value proposition: saving time and money. Instructions should be clear and avoid technical jargon.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- **WCAG 2.1 AA:** The application will maintain high standards for color contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader support.
- **Mobile-First:** Given the use case (shopping), the UI must be fully responsive and optimized for touch interactions on mobile devices as the primary platform.
